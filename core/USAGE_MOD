Usage for pipeline module:
<module_name>.mod -d <design> <options>

Compulsory arguments:
 -d : Localised design file for pipeline:
      Use xcpConfig for guided creation of a design
      file. Use xcpLocaliser to localise it to all
      subjects. (Localisation is automatically 
      completed by the xcpEngine.)

Optional arguments:
 -c : Context in pipeline:
      Input should be a positive integer that denotes
      the overall position of the module in the
      analytic pipeline.
 -t : Trace status:
      Boolean value ( 0[default] or 1 ) that indicates
      whether all commands called by the module should
      be traced and explicitly replicated in a log
      file. This log file can then be used to debug
      output or can be converted to a standalone
      pipeline.
