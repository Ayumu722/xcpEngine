Usage for pipeline module:
<module_name>.mod -d <design> <options>

Compulsory arguments:
 -d : Localised design file for pipeline:
      Use xcpConfig for guided creation of a design
      file. Use xcpLocaliser to localise it to all
      subjects. (Localisation is automatically 
      completed by the xcpEngine.)

Optional arguments:
 -c : Context in pipeline:
      Input should be a positive integer that denotes
      the overall position of the module in the
      analytic pipeline.
 -t : Trace status:
      Integer value ( 0 - 3 ) that indicates the level
      of verbosity during module execution. Higher
      levels reduce readability but provide useful
      information for troubleshooting.
      0  [default]: Human-readable explanations of
         processing steps and error traces only.
      1: Explicitly trace module-level computations.
         Print a workflow map when execution completes.
      2: Explicitly trace module- and utility-level
         computations.
      3: All commands called by the module and all
         children are traced and explicitly replicated
         in a log file. This log file can then be used
         to debug output.
