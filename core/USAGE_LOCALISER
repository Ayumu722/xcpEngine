Usage for pipeline localiser:
xcpLocaliser -d <design> <options>

Compulsory arguments:
 -d : Design file for pipeline:
      Includes all specifications for processing
      routines to be run as part of the current
      pipeline. Use xcpConfig for guided creation of
      a design file.

Optional arguments:
 -s : Subject index:
      Input should be a positive integer that denotes
      the internal index of the subject data that are
      to be localised.
 -t : Trace status:
      Boolean value ( 0[default] or 1 ) that indicates
      whether all commands called by the module should
      be traced and explicitly replicated in a log
      file. This log file can then be used to debug
      output or can be converted to a standalone
      pipeline.
