::NETWORK ANALYSIS : SUBJECT //SUBJECT//
::Numerous network analyses are included as options for the XCP Engine processing stream.
::Each analysed network is stored here as a hash-delimited list of associated analytic outputs.
::Potential outputs include:
::AL, the allegiance matrix (NYI)
::AM, the adjacency matrix
::AS, an index of activity states for this subject (NYI)
::CM, a list of community assignments for each node of the network (NYI)
::CS, an index of connectivity states for this subject (NYI)
::DC, dynamic community indices for each node at each time point (NYI)
::EG, timeseries of each of the network's edges (NYI)
::MC, the meta-adjacency/metaconnectivity matrix (NYI)
::MP, a definition of the network's map
::NM, the network name
::PJ, Pajek file representing the network
::SP, the space in which the network map is situated
::TN, time-by-time nodewise similarity matrix (NYI)
::TR, trajectory of the subject through connectome space (NYI)
::TS, mean timeseries of each of the network's nodes
::TT, time-by-time edgewise similarity matrix (NYI)
